# Story 0.3: Scaffold Global and Dashboard Layouts (Front‑End Only)

## Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** root and dashboard layouts with mocked sidebar & top‑bar navigation  
**so that** future pages inherit a consistent shell without yet relying on real data.

## Status
Draft

## Context
Layouts establish global providers and responsive navigation. All menu items link to placeholder pages using Next.js `<Link>`. User context will be mocked until auth backend exists.

## Estimation
Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria
1. - [ ] `app/layout.tsx` wraps children with `<html lang="en">`, `<body>`, and injects Tailwind classes.
2. - [ ] `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` contains sidebar (`Dashboard`, `Students`, `Reports`, `Analytics`, `Settings`) plus top bar with profile icon and bell icon (static).
3. - [ ] Sidebar collapses behind a hamburger using Radix Dialog below `md:` breakpoint.
4. - [ ] Navigating to `/dashboard` shows nested layout and placeholder “Dashboard Coming Soon”.

## Subtasks
1. - [ ] Build root layout.
2. - [ ] Build sidebar and top‑bar components.
3. - [ ] Create placeholder pages (`/dashboard`, `/students`, etc.).

## Testing Requirements
- `next lint` passes; `next build` passes with zero warnings.
- Playwright e2e test confirms sidebar links navigate without 500 errors.
