# Story 0.1: Initialize Next.js 15 App‑Router Project on Vercel

## Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** to bootstrap a new **Next.js 15** project with App Router and TypeScript, hosted on Vercel  
**so that** the team has a deployable baseline to build the entire front‑end against.

## Status
Draft

## Context
Front‑end work must begin immediately, independent of any backend services. A minimal, compilable Next.js project on Vercel will act as the integration target for every subsequent UI story. No database or API logic is included at this stage.

## Estimation
Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria
1. - [ ] GitHub repository **cfi‑pros** is created with MIT license and `main` branch set as default.
2. - [ ] Project created via `pnpm create next-app@latest` with **TypeScript**, **ESLint**, **Tailwind** enabled; sample code removed except `/app/page.tsx`.
3. - [ ] Repository is linked to Vercel; pushes to `main` trigger production deploy, PRs trigger preview URLs.
4. - [ ] Default page shows “CFIPros MVP Front‑End Ready” from a **server component**.
5. - [ ] `.env.example` committed (see Story 0.5) and referenced in README.

## Subtasks
1. - [ ] **Repo & Vercel**
   1. - [ ] Create repo, add branch protection.
   2. - [ ] Create Vercel project, set build command `pnpm run build`.
2. - [ ] **Scaffold**
   1. - [ ] Run bootstrap wizard.
   2. - [ ] Remove unused boilerplate assets.
3. - [ ] **Docs**
   1. - [ ] Add installation and `pnpm dev` instructions to README.

## Testing Requirements
- CI must run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, **`pnpm next build`**, and `pnpm next lint`; all pass with 0 errors/warnings.
- Lighthouse best‑practices score ≥ 90 on the landing page (GitHub Actions `treosh/lighthouse-ci`).
