# Story 1.6: Auth Middleware for Protected Routes

## Story
**As** site middleware  
**I must** redirect unauthenticated users to `/auth/signin` for protected paths  
**so that** sensitive pages are not visible without login.

## Status
Draft

## Context
Protect expanded list of routes (`/dashboard`, `/students`, `/reports`, `/analytics`, `/endorsements`, `/simulations`, `/marketplace`, `/community`, `/settings`).

## Estimation
Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria
1. - [ ] Middleware checks `authjs.session-token` cookie; redirects unauthenticated.
2. - [ ] Public routes (`/`, `/knowledge-base`, `/logbook-conversion`, `/api/__mock/*`) bypass guard.
3. - [ ] Playwright e2e confirms redirection.

## Subtasks
1. - [ ] Write middleware with matcher.
2. - [ ] Playwright test.

## Testing Requirements**
- CI lint/build/coverage + Playwright.
