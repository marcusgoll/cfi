# Story 1.1: Org-Admin Magic-Link Sign-Up (Stack-Auth)

## Story
**As a** prospective org admin  
**I want** to sign up with my email via a Stack-Auth magic-link flow  
**so that** a new flight-school workspace is created and I become its owner.

## Status
In Progress

## Context
Stack-Auth (Auth.js v2) is the recommended auth layer for our Neon.tech Postgres stack.  
Until the real DB is wired, we'll rely on `useAuthMock()` to simulate user storage and session creation.  
The flow renders **/auth/signup** → sends link with Resend → redirects user back with a `callbackUrl`‐style token processed by Stack-Auth.

## Estimation
Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria
1. - [ ] **Signup form** at `/auth/signup` collects **Name** + **Email**.
2. - [ ] Submitting calls mock route `/api/__mock/send-magic-link` which triggers `Resend.emails.send` (stub) and displays "Check your email".
3. - [ ] Visiting `/auth/callback?token=mock` uses Stack-Auth `handleAuth()` to validate token via `useAuthMock`, creates session `{ role:'admin', organizationId:'org_mock_123' }`.
4. - [ ] Session stored in `authjs.session-token` cookie; refresh persists login.
5. - [ ] Redirect to `/dashboard`; sidebar shows org name "My Flight School".
6. - [ ] CI gates pass: lint, test ≥ 85 %, `next build`, Lighthouse best-practices ≥ 90.

## Subtasks
1. - [x] Build signup page with shadcn `<Input>` + `<Button>`.
2. - [x] Mock send-link endpoint & toast.
3. - [x] Configure Stack-Auth Email provider with mock adapter.
4. - [ ] Dashboard verification.
5. - [ ] Jest + Playwright tests.

## Testing Requirements**
- All CI gates above.
