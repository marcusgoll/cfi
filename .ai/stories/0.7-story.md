# Story 0.7: Remove Prisma Setup from Initial Phase (Tracking Stub)

## Story
**As a** tech lead  
**I want** to postpone all backend schema work  
**so that** the front‑end sprint proceeds against mock data without backend blockers.

## Status
Draft

## Context
Original plan included Prisma early; we explicitly defer to a later epic. This tracking story simply closes the loop and documents the decision.

2. - [ ] Architecture doc is updated with comment “Backend starts Epic 4”.
