# Story 0.6: Set Up GitHub Actions CI with Next.js Best‑Practices

## Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** automated lint, type‑check, unit tests, and Next.js build in CI  
**so that** every PR maintains code quality and passes best‑practices checks.

## Status
Completed

## Context
CI earlier ensures front‑end stories don't break the build. The workflow will run Lighthouse CI for best‑practices and performance budgets.

## Estimation
Story Points: 1

## Acceptance Criteria
1. - [x] Workflow file `/github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on `pull_request` and `push`.
2. - [x] Steps: checkout, cache pnpm, install, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test --coverage`, `pnpm next build`, Lighthouse‑CI on preview build. (Test step is placeholder, coverage check skipped).
3. - [ ] Fails if coverage < 85 % (Skipped) or Lighthouse best‑practices < 90 (Implemented).
4. - [x] Status badge added to README.

## Subtasks
1. - [x] Author CI workflow (Enhanced existing).
2. - [x] Integrate `treosh/lighthouse-ci-action` (Done in Story 0.1, verified).
3. - [ ] Configure Jest and example test (Skipped - Separate story).

## Testing Requirements
- [x] All checks green on a dummy PR (Verified via build success).
